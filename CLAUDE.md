# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a documentation repository for the **Latent Framework** (潜在化された構文分析), a Japanese analytical framework for understanding projects through three core structural elements: Story, Economy, and Force. The repository contains theoretical documentation and practical applications of this framework.

## Project Structure

### Core Documentation
- `latent_framework.md` - Main framework documentation (1040+ lines, comprehensive theory)
- `latent_frameworks/` - Directory containing applied analyses and case studies

### Framework Applications
The `latent_frameworks/` directory contains practical applications of the Latent Framework to various domains:
- Business and project management concepts (GTD, Scrum, Lean Startup, OODA)
- Communication and organizational analysis
- Creative and artistic project analysis
- Academic and educational applications

## Key Concepts

### The 3×3×3 Structure
The framework analyzes projects through a hierarchical structure:

1. **Project (事業)** - The main endeavor
   - **Story (物語)** - What is communicated/expressed
     - Art (表現): Logic, Reframe, Blues
     - Craft (構築): Material, Design, Technique  
     - Science (再現): Measurement, Verification, Prediction
   - **Economy (経済)** - How it's sustained
     - Flow (流通): Logistics, Information, Market
     - Labor (労働): Task, Skill, Automation
     - Capital (資本): Loan, Sponsorship, Investment
   - **Force (強制)** - How it's protected/maintained
     - Norm (規範): Law, Contract, Custom
     - Control (統制): Authority, Policy, Credential
     - Propaganda (宣伝): Exposure, Cadence, Curation

### Story States
The framework identifies three states of narrative/story:
- **💎 Product** - Active, maintained by original creator
- **🎭 Marionette** - Performed/executed by others following original design
- **🏺 Legacy** - Original creator absent, form persists without original meaning

## Working with This Repository

### Content Language
- Primary content is in Japanese
- Framework concepts use both Japanese terms and English translations
- Emoji symbols are systematically used to represent framework elements

### File Naming Conventions
- Main theory: `latent_framework.md`
- Applications: `latent_frameworks/[domain]_[specific_topic].md`
- Files use descriptive names reflecting the subject matter being analyzed

### Documentation Standards
- Comprehensive theoretical grounding with practical examples
- Systematic use of framework terminology and symbols
- Historical and cultural references to support theoretical points
- Critical self-reflection on framework limitations and appropriate usage

### Content Themes
Files analyze various domains through the Latent Framework lens:
- Project management methodologies
- Organizational behavior and communication
- Creative and artistic endeavors
- Educational and academic applications
- Business strategy and entrepreneurship

## Framework Philosophy

The Latent Framework prioritizes:
1. **Story-centered analysis** - Understanding the narrative core of projects
2. **Non-MECE approach** - Intentional overlaps to trigger deeper thinking
3. **Structural thinking** - Decomposing complex projects into analyzable components
4. **Practical application** - Bridging theory with real-world project analysis

## Usage Notes

- This is a theoretical and analytical framework, not a prescription for success
- The framework acknowledges its own limitations and subjectivity
- Multiple perspectives and interpretations are encouraged
- AI-assisted analysis should complement, not replace, human narrative understanding
- Framework application should respect the original creator's intent and story

## Repository Maintenance

- Content is primarily theoretical and documentary
- No build processes, tests, or deployment pipelines
- Updates involve expanding framework applications and refining theoretical understanding
- Version control tracks conceptual evolution rather than code changes
